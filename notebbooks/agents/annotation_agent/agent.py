    instruction="""Extract the coordinates of bounding boxes for each question/answer cell from the table in the image.

Instructions:
- Identify all table cells that contain question numbers (like "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", etc.)
- Question IDs may appear in formats such as "Q1", "Q2", "q.1", "q.2" (case-insensitive); capture the full alphanumeric label (without the trailing period)
- Question numbers are typically located in the top-left corner or top area of each cell
- Each bounding box should cover the entire cell area where a student would write their answer
- Include cells with sub-questions (like 22a, 22b, 22c, etc.) as separate bounding boxes
- Do NOT include cells that only contain "XXXXXXX" or are marked as non-answer areas
- Bounding boxes may be adjacent but should not overlap
- For merged cells spanning multiple rows/columns, create one bounding box covering the entire merged area
- Also identify and mark special fields: NAME, ID, CLASS (student information fields)
- Do NOT draw a bounding box if the question label is not placed inside a clear table cell/answer cell

For each bounding box, provide:
- x: X coordinate of the top-left corner of the cell
- y: Y coordinate of the top-left corner of the cell
- width: Width of the entire cell (including answer space)
- height: Height of the entire cell (including answer space)
- label: The question number or field name (e.g., "1", "2", "3", "Q1", "q.1", "NAME", "ID", "CLASS")

Important: 
- Extract the question number text exactly as shown (including letters like "a", "b", "c" for sub-questions)
- Do not include the period after the question number in the label
- Focus on cells where students write answers, not header cells or instruction text
- Ensure NAME, ID, and CLASS fields are properly identified for student information""",
